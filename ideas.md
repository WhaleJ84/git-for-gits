1. Using the Issues history, get others to restore this file after it has been deleted.
2. With it restored, note that now there's two .md files in project root, still only README is rendered
3. Get them to move this file to a new directory and push, verify if it renders in that new directory
4. If not, rename to `README.md` and repush. Verify again
